# 🚀 Advanced Track: Self-Reflecting AI Agents

Build AI systems that **critique and improve their own responses** — the same principles behind ChatGPT, Claude, and cutting-edge research tools.

---

## 🎯 Who This Is For
Students with experience in:
- Python (classes, functions, modules)
- Prompt engineering & LLMs
- Jupyter or Colab environments

---

## 🧠 What You'll Build
1. **SimpleReflectiveAgent** – basic reflection + refinement  
2. **AdvancedReflectiveAgent** – customizable generation and critique strategies  
3. **MetaReflectiveAgent** – agents that critique their own critique  
---

## ⚙️ How to Run It

**Colab (Easy):**
- Open the notebooks in Google Colab
- No setup required

**Local (Advanced):**
```bash
cd advanced_track
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook
```

## 🧪 Track Overview

📍 Folder: [`advanced_track/`](./)  
Follow this order:

1. [`notebooks/workshop_tutorial.ipynb`](notebooks/workshop_tutorial.ipynb)  
   → Core reflection loop and architecture

2. [`notebooks/advanced_experiments.ipynb`](notebooks/advanced_experiments.ipynb)  
   → Strategy comparison & performance analysis

3. [`notebooks/research_extensions.ipynb`](notebooks/research_extensions.ipynb)  
   → Meta-agents, convergence control, research ideas

Code lives in [`lib/agents.py`](lib/agents.py)

## 🔁 Reflection Loop (Core Architecture)
```
Problem → Generate → Critique → Refine → Is it good?
                                    ↑           ↓
                                    ←── No ──── Yes → Final
```

---

## 🌟 Why It Matters

These agents simulate:
- Self-improving AI workflows
- Modular agentic design
- Evaluation + convergence logic

Used in: ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, Claude, and Reflexion-style research.

    "## 📚 Step 1: Understanding Self-Reflection\n",
    "\n",
    "Think about how you solve problems:\n",
    "1. **First attempt** - You try something\n",
    "2. **Check your work** - You review what you did\n",
    "3. **Improve it** - You make it better\n",
    "4. **Repeat** until satisfied\n",
    "\n",
    "That's exactly what we're teaching AI to do!\n",
    "\n",
    "## 💡 The Core Idea\n",
    "\n",
    "It's like **automated code review** but for any problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "1. AI writes initial solution\n",
    "2. AI critiques its own work  \n",
    "3. AI improves based on critique\n",
    "4. Repeat until good enough\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real-world analogy**: When you write code, run tests, find bugs, fix them, repeat.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it works**: Multiple passes catch more issues than one-shot responses."

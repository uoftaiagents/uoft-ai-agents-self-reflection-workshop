# 🧠 Can an AI Think for Itself? - UofT AI Agents Club Workshop

## 🚀 Quick Start

Choose your track based on your experience level:

### 🌟 **Beginner Track**

Start here if you're new to AI agents or want a gentle introduction:
```
📁 beginner_track/
├── intro_to_ai_agents.ipynb          # Start here first
└── intro_to_self_reflecting_agents.ipynb  # Then this
```

### 🔬 **Advanced Track** (For experienced developers)

For those comfortable with Python, AI concepts, and prompt engineering:
```
📁 advanced_track/
├── 📖 README.md                      # Read this comprehensive guide first
├── 📓 notebooks/
│   ├── 1️⃣ workshop_tutorial.ipynb       # 🎯 Start here (20 min)
│   ├── 2️⃣ advanced_experiments.ipynb    # 🧪 Then experiments (15 min)
│   └── 3️⃣ research_extensions.ipynb     # 🔬 Finally research (20 min)
└── 🐍 lib/agents.py                  # Complete agent library
```

**Prerequisites**: Python classes/modules, basic prompt engineering, familiarity with LLMs

## 🎯 What You'll Build

Self-reflecting AI agents that can:
- Generate responses to problems
- Critique their own work
- Improve through iterative reflection
- Adapt to different domains and challenges

## 💡 Key Concepts

**Self-Reflection Loop**:
```
Problem → Generate → Evaluate → Refine → Better Solution
            ↑                               ↓
            ←──── Keep Improving ──────────┘
```

## 🛠️ Installation

1. **Clone this repository**
2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   # For beginner track
   cd beginner_track
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
   # For advanced track
   cd advanced_track  
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Start Jupyter**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## 🤝 Need Help?

- **Start with the beginner track** if you're unsure
- **Read the README** in each track directory
- **Follow the notebooks** in order
- **Experiment** with different problems and configurations

## 🏆 Learning Outcomes

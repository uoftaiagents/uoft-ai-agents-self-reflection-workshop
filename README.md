# 🧠 UofT AI Agents Club – Self-Reflecting AI Workshop

Welcome to the official workshop repository for the **UofT AI Agents Club**!  
This workshop introduces the concept of **self-reflecting AI agents** — intelligent systems that can critique and refine their own responses through recursive reasoning and evaluation.

Whether you're just starting out or already experienced with AI, this repo offers **beginner** and **advanced** tracks to help you explore the core ideas behind modern agentic AI systems like ChatGPT, Claude, and Reflexion-style agents.

## 🚀 Quick Start

**👉 New here? Start with [`GETTING_STARTED.md`](GETTING_STARTED.md) 👈**

Choose your experience level:
- 🌟 **Beginner Track**: For those new to LLMs, prompt engineering, or AI agents  
- 🔬 **Advanced Track**: For students familiar with Python, LLMs, and basic AI system design

## 🌟 Beginner Track

Start here if you’re curious about how agents work but don’t have deep experience with AI.

📍 Folder: [`beginner_track/`](beginner_track/)  
🧠 Learn:
- What makes agents different from chatbots
- How to simulate agentic reasoning without any API keys
- Simple feedback loops: **Think → Critique → Improve**

🎯 Outcomes:
- Build a self-reflecting agent in a few lines of Python
- Understand recursive thinking and prompt engineering
- See improvements in responses over multiple iterations

---

## 🔬 Advanced Track

For students with experience in AI/ML, prompt engineering, or using LLM APIs.

📍 Folder: [`advanced_track/`](advanced_track/)  
Includes:
- Modular agent architecture
- Multiple reasoning styles and critique modes
- Research-level techniques like meta-reflection and convergence analysis

🧪 Try notebooks in this order:
1. [`workshop_tutorial.ipynb`](advanced_track/notebooks/workshop_tutorial.ipynb)
2. [`advanced_experiments.ipynb`](advanced_track/notebooks/advanced_experiments.ipynb)
3. [`research_extensions.ipynb`](advanced_track/notebooks/research_extensions.ipynb)

⚙️ Core logic lives in [`agents.py`](advanced_track/lib/agents.py)

## 🛠 Setup

### Option A: Run on Google Colab (recommended for beginners)
- Open any notebook and click “Open in Colab”
- No installation or API keys required

### Option B: Local (for advanced users)
```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/uoftaiagents/uoft-ai-agents-workshop.git
cd uoft-ai-agents-workshop

# (Optional) Create a virtual env
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start Jupyter
jupyter notebook
```

## 📣 About the Club

**UofT AI Agents Club** is a student-led group focused on exploring agentic AI — systems that plan, reason, and act autonomously.  
We host:
- 🧪 Technical workshops  
- 🤝 Industry collaborations (e.g. Voiceflow)  
- 🎤 Guest speakers & panels  
- 🧠 Open-source agent projects

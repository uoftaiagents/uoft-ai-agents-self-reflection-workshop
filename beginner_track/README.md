# 🚀 Beginner Track: Introduction to AI Agents

### **Workshop: “Can AI Think for Itself?”**

A hands-on intro to building self-reflecting AI — agents that can **critique**, **refine**, and **improve** their own answers.  
Perfect for students curious about how ChatGPT-style systems actually work.

---

## 🧠 What You’ll Learn
- What makes an **AI agent** different from a chatbot  
- How **prompt engineering** guides AI behavior  
- The **Think → Critique → Improve** loop  
- How this connects to real CS/ML concepts

---

## 🛠️ What You’ll Build
A working self-reflecting agent that:
1. Generates answers  
2. Critiques itself  
3. Improves its response  
4. Tracks its reasoning along the way  

---

## 🎮 Try It Yourself
- Interactive notebook with examples and challenges  
- Compare responses before and after reflection  
- Customize prompts, styles, and feedback modes  
- Extend the agent for more advanced reasoning

---

## 💡 No Experience Needed!
- 🐍 Basic Python (functions, loops)
- 💻 Jupyter / Colab
- 🕒 40–60 minutes
- ❌ No API keys required

    "**1. Iterative Algorithms**\n",
    "- Your agent uses a loop to repeatedly improve its output\n",
    "- Similar to how gradient descent improves ML models step by step\n",
    "- Each iteration uses the previous result as input (like dynamic programming)\n",

    "**2. State Management**\n",

    "- Similar to how compilers track symbol tables during compilation\n",
    "- Each step builds on previous knowledge\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Heuristic Evaluation**\n",
    "- The agent has simple rules for when to stop improving\n",
    "- Similar to heuristics in search algorithms (A*, hill climbing)\n",
    "- Trade-off between computational cost and solution quality\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Modular Architecture**\n",
    "- Separate components for generation, evaluation, and refinement\n",
    "- Follows single responsibility principle from software engineering\n",
    "- Easy to modify or extend individual components\n",

    "**AI/ML**: This is a simplified version of how AI systems like ChatGPT are trained using **Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Software Engineering**: The reflection pattern is used in **test-driven development** - write test, write code, refactor, repeat\n",
    "\n",
    "**Algorithms**: Similar to **approximation algorithms** that iteratively improve solutions to hard problems\n",
